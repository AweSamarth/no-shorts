YouTube Shorts, when viewed on a computer, use a completely different player with a whole new format. Scrubbing (going back / forward by a few seconds) is impossible, the description is basically hidden and the scroll-down-to-view-comments instinct now fails. I would rather view suggestions on the right hand side than to just jump to a new video on the slightest scroll. So, I decided to make this extension.

This extension makes of the declarativeNetRequest API, which is only available in Chrome Manifest V3. No script injection takes place.

## How to Use
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store this
2. use: 
```git clone https://github.com/AweSamarth/no-shorts/ ```
3. Open Chrome (or any Chromium based browser)
4. Enter `chrome://extensions` in the url bar.
5. Toggle 'Developer Mode'
6. Click on Load Unpacked
7. Select the folder named no-shorts

That's pretty much it! Enjoy browsing YouTube while this extension does all the work for you behind the scenes!
