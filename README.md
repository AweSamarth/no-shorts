YouTube Shorts, when viewed on a computer, use a completely different player with a whole new format. Scrubbing (going back / forward by a few seconds) is impossible, the description is basically hidden and the scroll-down-to-view-comments instinct now fails. I would rather view suggestions on the right hand side than to just jump to a new video on the slightest scroll. So, I decided to make this extension.

This extension makes of the declarativeNetRequest API, which is only available in Chrome Manifest V3. No script injection takes place.
